# 10clouds_form
  Simple page with animation and form with personal information. Mobile and desktop versions, mobile first approach.

## 1. Getting started
  You can view project on https://majkamajka.github.io/10clouds_form/ or clone repository and open index.html file.

## 2. Technologies used
  HTML5, CSS3, Gulp, Sass, JavaScript, jQuery

## 3. Issues
  - cross-browser compatibility: site is tested mostly on Google Chrome. Due to the lack of time there are some differences on other browsers (e.g. warnings placemet in Firefox...). Not tested on IE / Edge at all.
  - form validation: validation is really simple, for real usage it should be redone.
