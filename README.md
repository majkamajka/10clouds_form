## 4. Issues
  - cross-browser compatibility: site is tested mostly on Google Chrome. Due to the lack of time there are some differences on other browsers (e.g. warnings placemet in Firefox...). Not tested on IE / Edge at all.
  - form validation: validation is really simple, for real usage it should be redone.
